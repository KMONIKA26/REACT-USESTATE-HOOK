#### 2. Dynamic Form with React useState Hook

## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of React's `useState` hook to create a dynamic form that allows users to add or remove input fields for entering multiple hobbies. The form maintains an array of hobbies as its state and provides functionality to add new hobbies, remove existing ones, and submit the form data.

## Features

- Initial Form State: Start with a single input field for entering a hobby.
- Dynamic Input Fields: Add or remove input fields for hobbies as needed, except for the first input field.
- State Management: Uses the `useState` hook to manage the array of hobbies.
- Form Submission: Logs the array of hobbies to the console when the submit button is clicked.
- User-Friendly UI: Provides clear indications for adding/removing inputs and a visible submit button.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open the project in your preferred code editor.
3. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
4. Start the development server with `npm start`.
5. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

## Implementation Details
